# Example R / Github Project
This repository (repo) provides a template for an Accounting / Finance research project using R. This repo will contain the files needed to follow along with the live coding workshop.

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started / Installation Guide </h2>

In order to "clone" (copy) this repository to your machine and follow along with the R workshop, you will need to install Git, R, RStudio, and several R packages to your machine. I will provide the installation steps for a Windows machine, but the steps are very similar for MacOS or Linux. 

<p>1. Install Git.</p>

Follow the steps at this link: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

I think it is a good idea to allow this option to install git into your PATH so that RStudio can find it.

It is also helpful to allow git to install the credential manager to help with storing your github credentials.

<p>2. Install R </p>

Before you install RStudio, you should first install R from the following link: https://cran.rstudio.com/

If you already have R on your machine, I recommend at least R version 4.0 or better to follow along with the code in this repo. If you use an older version of R, you may see some warnings about R packages being built with a different version, but usually everything will still work.


<p>3. Install RStudio </p>

Install RStudio Desktop from the following link: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

As shown in the screenshot, R should be installed first, as we did in the previous step.
